This is a graphical client for the Ricochet Robots protocol
server, written by Bart Massey in Java. It is part of the
Ricochet Robotics project (http://github.com/ricochet-robotics).

Some important functionality, new game creation in
particular, is currently only stubbed in, so the software
needs more work before it will quite be usable.

To build, "javac RRClient.java". To run, "java RRClient".
